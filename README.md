# PassDB

## Description

**PassDB** is a Python tool designed to efficiently sort combolists and provide fast, easy retrieval of `email:password` combinations. It's ideal for parsing and managing credential dumps with minimal effort.

## Recommendations

For optimal performance, we recommend using PassDB on Linux, as file I/O operations tend to be significantly faster compared to Windows.
Additionally, using a Btrfs-formatted system is advised. Btrfs supports seamless compression with zstd, which helps reduce the database size and improves performance.
For the best experience, install PassDB on an SSD rather than an HDD, as SSDs handle small file access much more efficiently.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeFaucheur0769/PassDB.git
cd PassDB
```

### 2. Set up the Python environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup

#### Windows

Should be ready to work however the process of adding files to the database is much slower than on linux due to windows limitations while handeling many I/O actions. If you can't run it under linux the best is to run everything inside wsl and move the files in the wsl disk however most of the tool should still work if you are using windows

#### Linux

Make sure that the files in the src folder are executable by the stystem or else you will have an error and have to delete the hash_db file before trying again.

## Getting Started

On the first run, PassDB will automatically create the necessary folders and files.
You can customize these paths and behaviors in the [configuration file](#gear-config).

## ⚙ Config

PassDB is highly configurable via the `passdb.yml` file located in the project directory.

| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `db_location`              | Path where processed combolists (databases) will be stored                                                                          |
| `create_db_in_toolFolder`  | If `true`, PassDB stores databases inside the tool’s directory. If `false`, you will be prompted for a custom location on first run |
| `import_location`          | Path from which raw combolists are imported                                                                                         |
| `export_results_location`  | Directory where search results or exports are saved                                                                                 |
| `print_result_export_file` | If `true`, results will be printed to the terminal even if they're being exported                                                   |
| `dynamic_menus`            | If `true`, PassDB will use the interactives menus                                                                                   |
| `quiet`                    | If `true`, disables interactivity and only prints results (useful for scripting)                                                    |
